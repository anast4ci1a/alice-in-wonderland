        <h2> Lewis Carroll</h2>
        <p class="lc-description">Lewis Carroll, born Charles Lutwidge Dodgson on January 27, 1832, in Daresbury, England, was a <br> celebrated English writer, mathematician, and logician. He is best known for his classic children's books <br> Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and its sequel Through the Looking-Glass (1871). Carroll's <br> work is distinguished by its playful use of logic, fantasy, and wordplay, captivating both young and adult <br> readers. A lecturer in mathematics at Christ Church, Oxford, Carroll also pursued interests in <br> photography and was a noted pioneer in this field. His enduring influence is reflected in the whimsical <br> nature of his writing and his contributions to literary nonsense. Carroll passed away on January 14, <br> 1898, leaving behind a legacy that continues to enchant generations.</p>
