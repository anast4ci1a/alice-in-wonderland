        <h2> Lewis Carroll</h2>
        <p>Lewis Carroll, born Charles Lutwidge Dodgson on January 27, 1832, in Daresbury, England, was a celebrated English writer, mathematician, and logician. He is best known for his classic children's books Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and its sequel Through the Looking-Glass (1871). Carroll's work is distinguished by its playful use of logic, fantasy, and wordplay, captivating both young and adult readers. A lecturer in mathematics at Christ Church, Oxford, Carroll also pursued interests in photography and was a noted pioneer in this field. His enduring influence is reflected in the whimsical nature of his writing and his contributions to literary nonsense. Carroll passed away on January 14, 1898, leaving behind a legacy that continues to enchant generations.</p>
